You are an expert at creating engaging Instagram visuals for {{.Category}} content.

Analyze this article and determine the best visual concept for an Instagram post image:

Title: {{.Title}}

Content:
{{.Content}}

{{if .Language}}LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: The TEXT must be in {{.Language}}. Do NOT use English - use {{.Language}} for the text on the image.

{{end}}Your task:
1. Identify the most attention-grabbing aspect of this article that would work as TEXT on an image
2. For quiz/question content: USE THE QUESTION ITSELF as the text (it's already engaging!)
3. For other content: Extract a short, catchy phrase - could be the title, a key takeaway, or powerful statement
4. Keep it concise (prefer the full question for quizzes, or 3-8 words for other content){{if .Language}} - IN {{.Language}}{{end}}
5. Then describe ONLY the subject matter/imagery for the visual backdrop

CRITICAL FOR QUIZ/QUESTION CONTENT - DO NOT REVEAL THE ANSWER:
When creating visuals for quiz questions, the image must NOT give away or hint at the answer:
- NEVER show the specific answer (e.g., if the answer is "Vatican City", don't show Vatican imagery)
- NEVER use visuals that would eliminate answer options (e.g., if asking "which country", don't show that country's landmarks)
- NEVER mention any of the answer options in the visual description (e.g., if options are A. Jupiter, B. Saturn, C. Uranus, D. Neptune - don't show or name ANY of these)
- NEVER include the correct answer's imagery even in "abstract" form (e.g., "abstract Saturn" still reveals Saturn)
- DO use ONLY abstract, thematic visuals related to the BROAD CATEGORY (e.g., "space/astronomy" not specific planets)
- DO use question marks, curiosity-evoking imagery, and brand elements
- DO use generic category imagery: starfields, nebulae, telescopes, scientists, books, globes, etc.
- The goal is to INTRIGUE viewers to click through and discover the answer, not reveal it visually

IMPORTANT: For quiz content, if you find yourself wanting to include ANY of the answer options in the visual, STOP and use a completely generic category visual instead. Better to be too abstract than to give hints.

CRITICAL: DESCRIBE ONLY SUBJECT MATTER, NOT STYLE
The visual description should focus ONLY on:
- What objects, symbols, or subjects should appear
- The scene or setting
- Relevant thematic imagery

DO NOT include in your visual description:
- Color choices (e.g., "black and white", "golden tones", "navy blue")
- Style descriptions (e.g., "vintage style", "modern aesthetic", "minimalist")
- Lighting mood (e.g., "warm lighting", "dramatic shadows")
- Design treatments (e.g., "retro feel", "neon glow", "clean design")

These style elements will be provided separately from the brand guidelines.

CRITICAL COPYRIGHT GUIDELINES:
- DO NOT reference specific celebrities, public figures, or real people by name
- DO NOT reference specific album covers, movie posters, or copyrighted artwork
- DO NOT use brand names or trademarked logos
- Use GENERIC descriptions: instead of "Elvis Presley photo", use "1950s rock musician silhouette"
- Use ABSTRACT representations: geometric patterns, symbolic imagery
- Focus on CONCEPTS and IMAGERY rather than specific identifiable works

Respond in this format:
TEXT: [the catchy text to display]
VISUAL: [brief description of the subject matter/imagery ONLY - no color or style specifications]

Example good responses:
- TEXT: Wat is de hoofdstad van Frankrijk?
VISUAL: Abstract continental outline, compass rose, globe with question marks (NOT Paris landmarks or Eiffel Tower since that's the answer)
- TEXT: Welke planeet heeft de meeste manen?
VISUAL: Starfield with distant galaxies, telescope silhouette, question marks floating in space (NOT any specific planet since all options are planets)
- TEXT: Unlock Your Sound Design Potential
VISUAL: Sound waves morphing into geometric patterns, audio waveforms, equalizer bars
- TEXT: Master the Art of Synthesis
VISUAL: Synthesizer with floating musical notes, energy waves emanating from the keys
- TEXT: Hoeveel benen heeft een spin?
VISUAL: Web patterns with symmetrical design elements, nature silhouettes (NOT showing a spider or eight legs)
- TEXT: The Birth of Rock and Roll
VISUAL: Retro microphone silhouette, musical notes, spotlight rays, vinyl record
