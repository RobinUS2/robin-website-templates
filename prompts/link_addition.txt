Add relevant external links to the following article. DO NOT change the writing style, tone, or any of the existing content. ONLY add links where they genuinely enhance the article.

Original content:
---
{{.Content}}
---
{{.LinksSection}}
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- First, SORT the candidate links by relevance to the article content (most relevant first)
- ONLY include links that are HIGHLY RELEVANT and genuinely add significant value
- Use a MAXIMUM of {{.MaxLinks}} links, but prefer fewer if not all are highly relevant
- SKIP any link that is only tangentially related or doesn't directly enhance the article
- REMOVE any links that are just brand homepages, product pages, or low-quality content
- Quality over quantity - it's better to have 1-2 excellent links than {{.MaxLinks}} mediocre ones
- Links can be embedded naturally in the existing text or added at the bottom as "Further Reading" or "Related Resources"
- For highly trusted sources (Wikipedia, YouTube, official documentation, government sites, academic institutions), use normal links: [text](URL)
- For less authoritative sources, use: [text](URL){rel="nofollow ugc"}
- ONLY use the candidate links provided - do NOT make up new URLs
- If NONE of the candidate links are highly relevant, don't include any - return the content unchanged
- DO NOT rewrite or change the existing content - only add links where appropriate
- Do NOT use horizontal rules (---) as section separators
