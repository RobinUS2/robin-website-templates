IMPORTANT FILTERING RULES:
- SKIP obvious/basic links that a beginner-level user would already know
- Assume the audience has foundational knowledge
- ONLY suggest links that provide DEEP DIVE information, advanced techniques, or specialized knowledge
- Avoid brand homepages or product overview pages unless they contain substantial educational content
- Focus on tutorials, in-depth guides, academic resources, or expert-level content
