3. Start with an attention-grabbing hook or question
4. Include 1-3 relevant emojis that match the content theme
5. Include the article link with a call-to-action in the SAME language:
   - If {{.Language}} is English: "👉 Read more: {{.ArticleURL}}"
   - If {{.Language}} is Dutch: "👉 Lees meer: {{.ArticleURL}}"
   - Translate appropriately for other languages
6. Generate 3-5 relevant hashtags (in English, hashtags are usually in English)
7. Keep the tone {{.Tone}} but also informative
8. Telegram allows more text than other platforms, so you can be descriptive

IMPORTANT: The entire caption text MUST be in {{.Language}}. Do not mix languages.

If this is quiz content, also generate a poll:
- Extract the main question and answer options from the content
- Identify the correct answer index (0-based)
- Add a brief explanation for the correct answer

    "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
    "correct_index": 0,
    "explanation": "Brief explanation of the correct answer"
  }
}
