Please evaluate:
1. Would visuals REALLY help the reader understand or engage with this content better?
2. What type of visual would be most helpful?
   - RASTER IMAGE: For photos, realistic scenes, equipment, environments (costs $0.02-0.04)
   - SVG DIAGRAM: For technical diagrams, flowcharts, signal flows, architecture diagrams, process flows (free, better for technical content)
3. What specific visual concept would be most helpful?

Respond in this EXACT format:
DECISION: [YES or NO]
VISUAL_TYPE: [RASTER or SVG or NONE]
REASON: [One sentence explaining why visuals would or wouldn't add value]
PROMPT: [If YES, provide ONE detailed prompt. For SVG: describe the diagram structure. For RASTER: provide DALL-E prompt. If NO, write "NONE"]

Be critical and selective - only approve visuals that truly enhance understanding or engagement. Prefer SVG for technical/diagrammatic content.
