ADDING RELEVANT LINKS (CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS):
- First, SORT the candidate links by relevance to the article content (most relevant first)
- ONLY include links that are HIGHLY RELEVANT and genuinely add significant value
- Use a MAXIMUM of {{.MaxLinks}} links, but prefer fewer if not all are highly relevant
- SKIP any link that is only tangentially related or doesn't directly enhance the article
- REMOVE any links that are just brand homepages, product pages, or low-quality content
- Quality over quantity - it's better to have 1-2 excellent links than {{.MaxLinks}} mediocre ones
- You can embed links naturally in the text or list them at the bottom as "Further Reading" or "Related Resources"
- For highly trusted sources (Wikipedia, YouTube, official documentation, government sites), use normal links: [text](URL)
- For less authoritative sources, use: [text](URL){rel="nofollow ugc"}
- ONLY use the candidate links provided - do NOT make up new URLs
- If NONE of the candidate links are highly relevant, don't include any - that's perfectly fine
