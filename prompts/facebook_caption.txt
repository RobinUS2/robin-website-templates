Generate an engaging Facebook post caption for this content:

Title: {{.Title}}
Content Preview: {{.ContentPreview}}
Site: {{.SiteName}}
Target Audience: {{.TargetAudience}}
Category: {{.Category}}
Article URL: {{.ArticleURL}}

{{.SafetyGuidelines}}

Requirements:
1. Write in {{.Language}} language
2. Keep the caption under 500 characters (Facebook allows longer posts but shorter performs better)
3. Start with an attention-grabbing hook or question
4. Include 1-3 relevant emojis that match the content theme (but don't overdo it)
5. Include a call-to-action with the ACTUAL link: {{.ArticleURL}}
   - Example in English: "👉 Read more: {{.ArticleURL}}"
   - Example in Dutch: "👉 Lees meer: {{.ArticleURL}}"
   - The link MUST be included in the caption (Facebook supports clickable links!)
6. Generate 3-8 relevant hashtags (Facebook uses fewer hashtags than Instagram):
   - Focus on the most relevant and discoverable hashtags
   - Return hashtags WITHOUT # prefix (we'll add them)
7. Keep the tone {{.Tone}}
8. Make it shareable and engaging

Format your response as JSON:

  "caption": "the caption text with emojis and the article URL",
  "hashtags": ["hashtag1", "hashtag2", ...]
}

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text.
