Your task:
1. Identify any sections that pose CRITICAL safety or legal risks
2. Remove ONLY those specific dangerous sections
3. Clean up any placeholder text like [INSERT IMAGE], [TODO], [PLACEHOLDER], [MEDIA NEEDED], [IMAGE NEEDED], [LINK NEEDED], [VIDEO NEEDED], [EXAMPLE NEEDED], etc.
4. Replace all em dashes (—) and en dashes (–) with regular hyphens (-)
5. Return the cleaned, safe version of the article

Provide your response in this exact format:
SAFE: [YES or NO]
CONCERN_TYPE: [NONE if safe, CLEANABLE if issues can be fixed by cleaning, MUST_FAIL if content has fabricated/unverifiable facts that cannot be salvaged]
CONCERNS: [If not safe, list what was found. If safe, write "None"]
CLEANED_CONTENT:
[Full article text with dangerous sections removed and placeholders cleaned]

CONCERN TYPE GUIDELINES:
- NONE: Content is safe, no issues found
- CLEANABLE: Issues like placeholder text, tone problems, minor claims that can be reworded to generic form - proceed with cleaned content
- MUST_FAIL: Content contains FABRICATED historical facts, fake origin stories, invented statistics, or unverifiable claims presented as truth that CANNOT be simply cleaned - this content should be rejected entirely and regenerated

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- General factual accuracy without sources is ACCEPTABLE - only flag if dangerously wrong
- Technical advice within the site's domain is ACCEPTABLE - this is expected content
- Business/career general guidance is ACCEPTABLE (e.g., "build a following", "be consistent")
- Specific financial predictions or ROI estimates are NOT ACCEPTABLE (e.g., "you'll earn $X", "expect 20%% ROI")
- General encouragement about career potential is ACCEPTABLE - only flag specific income promises
- Focus on SERIOUS issues that could cause harm or legal liability
- Minor factual imperfections or stylistic choices are fine
- Remove ALL placeholder patterns including: [INSERT IMAGE], [TODO], [LINK HERE], [MEDIA NEEDED], [IMAGE NEEDED], [LINK NEEDED], [VIDEO NEEDED], [EXAMPLE NEEDED], etc.
- Replace ALL em dashes (—) and en dashes (–) with regular hyphens (-) for consistent typography
