IMPORTANT RULES:
1. DO NOT use generic site-level tags like "{{.Category}}", "music production", "cooking", etc.
2. Focus on the PRIMARY topics, techniques, tools, or concepts covered in the article
3. Tags should be broad enough to group similar articles together, but specific enough to be meaningful
4. Prefer well-known terms, techniques, or tools over overly niche concepts
5. Keep tags concise (1-2 words preferred, max 3 words)
6. Use lowercase with hyphens for multi-word tags
7. Avoid very similar tags (e.g., don't use both "reverb" and "reverb-technique")

Examples of GOOD balanced tags for a music production site:
- "compression"
- "mixing"
- "ableton"
- "synthesis"
- "mastering"
- "edm"
- "vocals"

Examples of tags that are TOO SPECIFIC:
- "strategic-silence-in-larry-heard-productions"
- "emotional-high-points"
- "specific-producer-pause-technique"

Examples of BAD generic tags:
- "music-production"
- "tips"
- "tutorial"
- "guide"

Respond with ONLY the tags, one per line, no numbering or bullets:
