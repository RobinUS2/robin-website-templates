{{if .Domain}}WORKING CONTEXT: This image is created on behalf of {{.Domain}}.{{end}}

MANDATORY BRAND STYLING (Must be followed exactly):
{{if .StyleDescription}}Style: {{.StyleDescription}}{{end}}
{{if .ColorPalette}}Color palette: {{.ColorPalette}}{{end}}
{{if .VisualElements}}Include elements like: {{.VisualElements}}{{end}}
{{if .AdditionalGuidance}}{{.AdditionalGuidance}}{{end}}

Subject matter to incorporate:
{{.VisualConcept}}

VISUAL STYLING HIERARCHY (when instructions conflict):
1. BRAND STYLING above (colors, style, elements) always takes precedence
2. Visual elements (composition, aesthetic, layout) from subject matter may be incorporated
3. Any content placement or structural suggestions from subject matter should be ignored
4. Focus on translating the visual concept into the brand's established aesthetic

Create a professional, eye-catching image perfect for Instagram.
IMPORTANT: The image MUST include the specified text prominently displayed. Use bold, readable typography that stands out against the background.

CRITICAL BACKGROUND AND CONTRAST REQUIREMENTS:
- ALWAYS use a colored, textured, or gradient background - NEVER plain white
- Background should be rich and visually interesting (deep colors, textures, patterns, or photography)
- Ensure HIGH CONTRAST between text and background for maximum readability
- If background is dark, use white or bright text. If background is light/medium, use dark or bold colored text
- Add a subtle text shadow, outline, or semi-transparent backing behind text if needed for legibility
- Test mentally: could you read this text from 3 feet away on a phone screen?

CRITICAL TEXT PLACEMENT FOR INSTAGRAM:
- Instagram displays posts in both square (1:1) and portrait formats
- Place ALL text in the CENTER of the image within the safe zone
- The safe zone is the middle 70% of the image (avoid top 15% and bottom 15%)
- Center the text both horizontally and vertically
- Keep text blocks compact and centered to ensure visibility in square crop
- Use multiple lines if needed, but keep all lines within the central safe zone
- Avoid placing any important text near edges, top, or bottom areas

Make the text large enough to read on mobile devices. Use complementary colors for maximum readability.
{{if .DomainName}}Include the domain name "{{.DomainName}}" subtly in the bottom center (small, elegant font that doesn't distract from the main text).{{end}}
Make it visually striking with strong composition and vibrant colors.
