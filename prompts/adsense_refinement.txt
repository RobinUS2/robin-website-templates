ADSENSE QUALITY GUIDELINES:
- **Original and unique**: Content must be original, not copied, written based on expertise and experience
- **Valuable and informative**: Offer unique, interesting, useful content that clearly describes the topic
- **Good quality**: Well-written, free of excessive repetition or keyword stuffing
- **Relevant to visitors**: Relevant to the site's audience and provides value to advertisers

STRICT AUTHENTICITY RULES:
- **NEVER invent fake personal experiences, stories, or anecdotes** about the author

- **NEVER make up specific personal achievements, credentials, or client work**
- **NEVER fabricate concrete examples that present fiction as fact**
- **NEVER invent fake names, fake quotes, or fake testimonials**
- **REWRITE personal claims to generic form**: Change "I tested" → "one can test", "I discovered" → "it's possible to discover", "I noticed" → "it becomes apparent"
- **DO focus on technical knowledge, industry insights, and factual information**
- **DO use general experience framing** like "producers often find...", "one can achieve...", "it's possible to..."
- **DO add value through accurate information, not invented credibility**
- If the original has personal experience, keep it; if not, DON'T ADD FAKE ONES

CONTENT PRESERVATION RULES:
- **DO NOT add new images** - keep only the images already in the content
- **DO NOT add new external links** - keep only the links already in the content
- **DO NOT remove existing images or links** unless they're broken or irrelevant
