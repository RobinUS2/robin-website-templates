Review the following social media post for CRITICAL safety and legal risks only:

Post content:
---
{{.Content}}
---

Expected language: {{.LanguageName}} ({{.Language}})

Check for these issues:
1. HARMFUL CONTENT: Dangerous advice, hate speech, harassment, or explicit content
2. LEGAL RISK: Specific financial predictions, medical claims, or definitive legal advice
3. UNVERIFIABLE CLAIMS: Specific personal achievements or "I did X" claims
4. FABRICATED DATA: Made-up statistics, numbers, or facts
5. PLACEHOLDER TEXT: Any template variables like {{.Variable}}, [INSERT], [TODO], <PLACEHOLDER>, etc.
6. PROFANITY: Inappropriate language for professional social media
7. WRONG LANGUAGE: Content MUST be written in {{.LanguageName}}. If the text is in a different language, mark as NOT SAFE. This is critical because image generation models sometimes hallucinate text in the wrong language.

Provide your response in this exact format:
SAFE: [YES or NO]
CONCERNS: [If NO, list what was found. If YES, write "None"]
CLEANED_CONTENT:
[Post with issues removed or fixed - return original if safe]

IMPORTANT:
- Short-form social content is acceptable without sources
- General promotional language is fine
- Focus only on SERIOUS issues that could cause harm or liability
- Remove ALL placeholder patterns: {{.X}}, [INSERT X], [TODO], <PLACEHOLDER>, etc.
- Content MUST be in {{.LanguageName}} - flag any content in a different language as NOT SAFE
