Generate {{.Count}} unique article topic ideas for a website about {{.Description}}.

Website Context:
- Name: {{.Name}}
- Category: {{.Category}}
- Format: {{.Format}}
- Target Audience: {{.TargetAudience}}
- Content Style: {{.ContentStyle}}{{if .ExistingTitles}}

Existing article titles to avoid duplicating:
{{.ExistingTitles}}{{end}}{{if .RecentTitles}}

RECENT ARTICLES (MOST IMPORTANT - DO NOT DUPLICATE THEMES OR CATEGORIES):
{{.RecentTitles}}

CRITICAL: Analyze the subjects, themes, and categories above. DO NOT generate topics about:
- The same subject matter (e.g., if recent articles are about music, avoid more music topics)
- Similar categories or themes (e.g., if there are multiple music questions, choose completely different domains like science, history, geography, sports, etc.)
- Related topics in the same field

You MUST ensure maximum diversity by selecting topics from DIFFERENT domains than what appears in recent articles.{{end}}{{if .PluginTopics}}

Refined article ideas from community sources (Reddit, forums):
{{.PluginTopics}}

These have been refined from community questions. You may use these directly or create related topics that address similar themes.{{end}}

For each topic, provide:
1. A compelling, SEO-friendly title (60-80 characters)
2. A brief rationale explaining why this topic is valuable
3. Keywords for trend analysis (2-4 relevant search terms, ORDERED BY RELEVANCE with the MOST IMPORTANT/SEARCHABLE keyword FIRST - e.g., for "Welke groente zit er in erwtensoep?" use ["erwtensoep", "Nederlandse keuken", "traditioneel gerecht"] where "erwtensoep" is the primary search term)

Consider:
- Current trends and seasonality
- Evergreen value
- Potential for engagement
- Monetization opportunities (affiliate links, ads)
- Search volume and competition
- Unique angles not commonly covered
- MAXIMUM DIVERSITY: Spread topics across different categories (music, sports, history, science, geography, pop culture, technology, etc.)

DIVERSITY RULES:
1. NO MORE THAN ONE topic from the same category (e.g., if you suggest one music topic, the rest must be from other categories)
2. Ensure each topic covers a DIFFERENT domain of knowledge
3. Avoid clustering topics around similar themes
4. Prioritize variety over depth in any single subject area

FORBIDDEN TOPICS - DO NOT GENERATE:
- Nazis, Hitler, Third Reich, Holocaust, concentration camps
- Genocide, ethnic cleansing, mass atrocities
- Religious persecution, antisemitism, Islamophobia
- Racism, racial discrimination, slavery (except purely educational)
- Terrorism, terrorist organizations
- War crimes, controversial political figures
- Conspiracy theories
- Murders, killings, executions, death-related news
- Child abuse, molestation, pedophilia, crimes against children
- Sexual assault, rape, sexual violence
- Prison, incarceration, criminal cases
- Suicides, self-harm, overdoses
- Mass shootings, gun violence, school shootings
- Domestic violence, abuse, human trafficking
- Celebrity deaths, scandals, court cases
- Any topic that could be seen as promoting hate or discrimination

Format your response as a numbered list:
1. Title: [Title Here]
   Keywords: [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]
   Rationale: [Why this topic is valuable]

2. Title: [Title Here]
   Keywords: [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]c
   Rationale: [Why this topic is valuable]

And so on...

IMPORTANT: Generate EXACTLY {{.Count}} topic ideas - no more, no less. Stop after {{.Count}} topics.
