5. Structure for readability:

LinkedIn best practices:
- Use line breaks to improve readability
- First 2 lines are critical (shown before "see more")
- Ask questions to drive comments
- Share insights or lessons learned
- Tag the article link at the end: "Read more: [URL]"

  "text": "the LinkedIn post text with emojis, line breaks, and URL at the end",
  "hashtags": ["hashtag1", "hashtag2", "hashtag3", "hashtag4"]
}
