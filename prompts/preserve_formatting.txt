CRITICAL: PRESERVE ALL FORMATTING SECTIONS

When rewriting, you MUST keep all collapsible sections EXACTLY as they are formatted. Do NOT change their syntax or structure.

COLLAPSIBLE SECTIONS - PRESERVE EXACTLY:

These sections use a specific markdown-like syntax that MUST be maintained:

:::hint Title Text Here
Content goes here
:::

:::answer Title Text Here
Content goes here
:::

:::context Title Text Here
Content goes here
:::

RULES YOU MUST FOLLOW:
1. Opening line format: `:::type Title` (where type is hint/answer/context)
2. Content on NEXT line after opening (not same line)
3. Closing line: `:::` alone on its own line
4. Keep ALL existing collapsible sections intact when making changes
5. If you need to add content INSIDE a collapsible section, place it between the opening and closing lines
6. If you need to add content OUTSIDE collapsible sections, place it before or after the `:::` markers

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
✓ Add new content OUTSIDE collapsible sections
✓ Modify text INSIDE collapsible sections (between opening and closing)
✓ Add new collapsible sections using the exact format above

WHAT YOU MUST NOT DO:
✗ Change `:::hint` to `:::spoiler` or any other variation
✗ Remove the space between `:::type` and the title
✗ Put content on same line as opening `:::hint Title`
✗ Use wrong closing syntax like `:::hint` instead of just `:::`
✗ Remove existing collapsible sections
✗ Change the structure of existing collapsible sections

EXAMPLE - CORRECT:
:::hint Remember This
This is important information that readers can expand.
:::

Some regular content here.

:::answer The Solution
Here's the answer to the question.
:::

EXAMPLE - INCORRECT (DO NOT DO THIS):
:::spoiler Remember This
This is wrong - spoiler is not a valid type
:::

:::hint Remember This - This content should be on next line
:::

:::hint Remember This
Content here
:::hint  ← WRONG: closing should be just :::

When you rewrite content, scan for these `:::` markers and ensure they remain exactly as formatted.
