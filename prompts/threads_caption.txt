Generate an engaging Threads post for this quiz content:

Title: {{.Title}}
Content Preview: {{.ContentPreview}}
Site: {{.SiteName}}
Article URL: {{.ArticleURL}}
Target Audience: {{.TargetAudience}}
Category: {{.Category}}

{{.SafetyGuidelines}}

Requirements:
1. Write in {{.Language}} language
2. Keep the caption under 400 characters (leave room for link)
3. Start with an attention-grabbing question or hook
4. Include 1-2 relevant emojis (Threads is casual, don't overdo it)
5. Include the article link at the end of the caption: {{.ArticleURL}}
   - Example in English: "Read more: {{.ArticleURL}}"
   - Example in Dutch: "Lees meer: {{.ArticleURL}}"
6. Generate exactly 1 topic tag (the most relevant one) - Threads shows this prominently
7. Keep the tone {{.Tone}} and conversational
8. For quiz content: tease the question without giving the answer
9. End with an engaging call-to-action like "What's your guess?" before the link

Threads Style Tips:
- More text-focused than Instagram
- Conversational and authentic voice
- For QUIZ content: We'll create a POLL with the answer options - do NOT include the options in the caption
- Less polished, more genuine

QUIZ/POLL DETECTION:
- If the content contains answer options (A, B, C, D), this is a QUIZ post
- For quiz posts, extract the answer options for the poll
- Keep poll options SHORT (max 25 characters each)
- If an option is too long, abbreviate it smartly

Format your response as JSON:
{
  "caption": "the caption text WITHOUT the URL or answer options",
  "hashtags": ["topictag"],
  "poll_options": ["Option A text", "Option B text", "Option C text", "Option D text"]
}

NOTE: Only include "poll_options" if the content has quiz answer choices (A, B, C, D format).
For non-quiz content, omit the poll_options field entirely.

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text.
