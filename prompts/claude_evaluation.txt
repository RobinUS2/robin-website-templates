Provide your response in this EXACT format:
CONFIDENCE: [number 0-100]
REASON: [brief explanation of why Claude would or wouldn't help]

The CONFIDENCE score represents how much Claude's capabilities would improve this content:
- 0-30: No benefit - general content, no technical depth needed
- 31-60: Minor benefit - some technical elements but ChatGPT handles well
- 61-80: Moderate benefit - technical content that would improve with Claude's reasoning
- 81-100: High benefit - complex technical/reasoning content ideal for Claude

Be honest and conservative - only recommend Claude if it would meaningfully improve the content.
