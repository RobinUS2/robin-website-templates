IMAGE STYLE GUIDE - HUMAN DESIGN AESTHETIC
===========================================

[MEDIUM SPECIFICATION]
Define the visual medium clearly:
- Editorial photography (real-world reference style)
- Flat graphic design (2D, minimal depth)
- Watercolor illustration (organic, hand-painted feel)
- Screen print poster (limited colors, bold shapes)
- Collage art (mixed media, layered)
- Line drawing (simple, hand-drawn)
- Vintage magazine layout (retro typography)

[STYLE REFERENCE]
Reference real-world design movements, not futuristic concepts:
- Bauhaus poster (geometric, primary colors, functional)
- 1970s magazine layout (earthy tones, bold typography)
- Scandinavian minimalism (clean, functional, natural materials)
- Swiss typography style (grid-based, sans-serif, mathematical)
- Mid-century modern (organic shapes, muted colors)
- Art Deco (geometric patterns, luxury aesthetic)
- Brutalist design (raw, concrete, honest materials)
- Japanese minimalism (negative space, natural elements)

[CONSTRAINT LANGUAGE]
Use words that imply limitation and human decision-making:
- Limited color palette (3-4 colors maximum)
- Simple shapes (circles, squares, triangles)
- Clean composition (organized, intentional)
- Restrained (holding back, not overdone)
- Minimal (only essential elements)
- Flat design (no depth, 2D)
- Matte finish (no shine or gloss)
- Single focal point (clear hierarchy)
- Geometric forms (structured, deliberate)

[EXCLUSION LIST]
Explicitly avoid AI's default tendencies:
- No plain white backgrounds - always use color, texture, or photography
- No low contrast text (text must always be readable against background)
- No glowing effects or light rays
- No neon colors or oversaturation
- No circuit patterns or digital grids
- No 3D renders or CGI aesthetics
- No dramatic studio lighting
- No lens flares or bokeh effects
- No futuristic aesthetics
- No chrome or metallic finishes
- No perfect symmetry or mathematical precision
- No stock photo people or generic scenes
- No gradient meshes or smooth blends
- No holographic or iridescent effects

[BACKGROUND AND CONTRAST REQUIREMENTS]
Always ensure readable, high-impact visuals:
- Use rich, colored backgrounds (deep blues, warm earth tones, muted greens, etc.)
- Textured backgrounds add visual interest (paper grain, fabric, concrete, wood)
- Photography backgrounds should have depth and context
- Text contrast is non-negotiable: light text on dark, dark text on light
- When in doubt, add a subtle text backing or shadow for legibility
- Avoid pastel-on-pastel or muted-on-muted color combinations for text

[IMPERFECTION REQUESTS]
Ask for subtle human touches:
- Slightly off-center composition
- Hand-drawn quality (imperfect lines)
- Natural lighting (window light, daylight)
- Visible texture (paper grain, canvas weave)
- Analog feel (film photography aesthetic)
- Weathered or worn elements
- Uneven spacing (human-placed, not grid-perfect)
- Color bleeding or registration shifts
- Subtle asymmetry

[REAL-WORLD CONTEXT]
Describe where this image would exist in reality:
- Magazine advertisement (editorial context)
- Museum poster (art institution)
- Book cover (literary or non-fiction)
- Architectural photography (building documentation)
- Product packaging (consumer goods)
- Concert poster (event promotion)
- Album artwork (music industry)
- Educational infographic (textbook or journal)
- Corporate brochure (business communication)
- Gallery exhibition print (fine art)

[IMPLEMENTATION NOTES]
When generating images:
1. Choose ONE medium specification
2. Reference ONE specific style/era
3. Apply 2-3 constraints from the constraint language
4. Include 3-5 items from the exclusion list
5. Add 1-2 imperfection requests
6. Ground it in ONE real-world context

Example: "Editorial photography in the style of 1970s magazine layouts. Limited earth-tone color palette, clean composition with single focal point, matte finish. No dramatic lighting, no oversaturation, no 3D renders. Natural window lighting, slightly off-center composition, visible film grain. Looks like it would appear in an architectural magazine."
